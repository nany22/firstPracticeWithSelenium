# firstPracticeWithSelenium

First Automation project using InteliJ(as IDE), Selenium, TestNG and Maven. It was done using the Pinterest Website, and using the Page Object Pattern.

We will need to have TestNG and Maven installed, to be able to run this project using them, or you could choose one of them.
